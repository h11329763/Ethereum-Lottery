# Ethereum-Lottery
This is designed to produce a random 0x... address with 12 mnemonic phrases.

First thing first: Anyone have the mnemonic phrases (or part of the list) could access to the address and transfer all the tokens in it.  In addition, the total combinations
of the mneomnic phrases are not infinite.  As a consequence, you can "accidentally" guess the right phrase combination and get the access to the address theoretically.

However, the number of the possible combination is enormously large, around 1E38 for 12 phrases.  Therefore, the chance you hit an address with Ethereum in it is merely
imporssibe.

But there is no harm to give it a try :) If you are interested in, try the .py and give it some time to run.  It will show you the notification when it hits one treasure.

Please let me know if you really hit one with this program.
We need some miracles in our drousy lives.
